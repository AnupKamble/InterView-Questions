## 1. What is Javascript? 
 ### JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language. It was originally designed for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, but has since become one of the most popular programming languages and is now used for a wide range of applications, including server-side programming, desktop applications, and mobile app development. JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build modern, interactive web applications. It is an object-oriented language with a syntax that is similar to other programming languages such as C and Java. JavaScript is also known for its event-driven and asynchronous programming model, which makes it well suited for building real-time applications.

## 2 . What are the data types in JavaScript?
### Number: for numeric values, both integer and floating-point.
### String: for sequences of characters, e.g. "hello".
### Boolean: for logical values, either true or false.
### Undefined: a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
### Null: a special value representing the absence of any object value.
### Object: for complex data structures, including arrays, functions, and dates.
### Symbol: a new data type in ECMAScript 6 that is unique and immutable.

## 3. What are variables in JavaScript?
### Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold values which can be of various data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc. Variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords, followed by a name and an optional assignment operator. The value can then be changed or reassigned as needed throughout the code. For example:

**javascript** 

`let name = "John Doe";`

`console.log(name);   // Output: "John Doe"`

`name = "Jane Doe";`

`console.log(name);   // Output: "Jane Doe" `

## 4. What is a function in JavaScript and how do you define it?
### A function in JavaScript is a block of code that can be executed repeatedly, and that can take inputs (arguments) and produce outputs (return values). Functions are defined using the function keyword, followed by a function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code surrounded by curly braces. Functions can be invoked (called) by using the function name followed by its parameters in parentheses. For example:

**javascript**

`function greet(name) { `

`console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");`
`}`

`greet("John Doe");   // Output: "Hello, John Doe!"`


<br>

<br>


## 5. What is closure in JavaScript?
### A closure in JavaScript is an inner function that has access to the variables and functions defined in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. A closure allows a function to "remember" its state, even after it has completed its execution. The closure has access to the variables and functions in its outer scope, and retains access to these variables even after the outer function has completed its execution. This makes closures useful for creating private variables and methods, and for creating functions that can be passed around as first-class objects. Here's an example of closure in JavaScript:

**javascript**

`function outerFunction(x) {`
  `return function innerFunction(y) {`
    `return x + y;`
  `}`
`}`

`const add5 = outerFunction(5);`
`console.log(add5(3)); // Output: 8`

## 6.What is the difference between let , var and const in JavaScript?

### The main difference between var and let in JavaScript is the way they handle variable scoping and hoisting.var is function scoped, which means that a variable declared with var is accessible within the entire function it was declared in. It is also hoisted to the top of its scope, meaning that it can be used before it is declared.

### let, on the other hand, is block scoped, which means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within the block it was declared in. It is not hoisted to the top of its scope like var, which means that it cannot be used before it is declared.

### const,const is also block scoped, but it cannot be reassigned to a new value once it has been declared. This makes it useful for declaring constants or values that should not change throughout the program.

**Here's an example to illustrate the difference:**

`function example() {`
  `console.log(x); // Output: undefined`
  `var x = 1;`
  `console.log(x); // Output: 1`
`}`

`function example2() {`
  `console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined`
  `let y = 2;`
  `console.log(y); // Output: 2`
`}`

`function example() {`
  `var x = 1;`
  `let y = 2;`
  `const z = 3;`

  `x = 4;`
 ` y = 5;`
  `// z = 6; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`

  `console.log(x); // Output: 4`
  `console.log(y); // Output: 5`
  `console.log(z); // Output: 3`
}


### In conclusion, const is best used for declaring constants, let for declaring variables that need to be reassigned, and var should generally be avoided in favor of let or const due to its function scoping and hoisting behavior.

## 7. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
### In JavaScript, null and undefined are both values that indicate the absence of a value or object, but they have different meanings.

### undefined is the default value assigned to variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value. It means that the variable has been declared but has no value assigned to it.

### null, on the other hand, is a value that is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value. It represents an intentional non-value, and is often used to indicate that an object reference has been intentionally cleared.

**Here's an example to illustrate the difference:**


`let x;`
`console.log(x); // Output: undefined`

`x = null;`
`console.log(x); // Output: null`

### In conclusion, undefined indicates that a variable has been declared but has no value assigned to it, while null represents an intentional non-value.

## 8. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

### Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes, regardless of where they are actually declared in the code.

### In other words, the JavaScript engine "hoists" the declarations to the top of the scope, making them available for use before the code execution reaches their actual declarations. This behavior is only applicable to the declarations and not to the assignments, which remain in their original positions in the code.

**Here's an example to illustrate hoisting:**


`console.log(x); // Output: undefined`
`var x = 1;`

`console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined`
`let y = 2;`

### In the first example, x is declared with var, so its declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope and it is accessible even before its assignment is executed. In the second example, y is declared with let, so it is not hoisted and is not accessible before its declaration.

### It is important to note that hoisting can lead to unexpected behavior in code, especially when using var. The use of let and const is generally preferred over var due to their block scoping behavior, which can make code easier to understand and prevent unintended behavior.

## 9. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
### In JavaScript, == and === are two comparison operators used to compare values. They both perform equality checks, but there are some important differences between them.

### == performs type coercion before comparison, meaning that it will attempt to convert the operands to a common type before comparing them. For example, '5' == 5 is true because the string '5' is implicitly converted to the number 5 before comparison.

### ===, on the other hand, does not perform type coercion before comparison. It checks for both value and type equality, meaning that the operands must be of the same type and have the same value to be considered equal. For example, '5' === 5 is false because the string '5' is not equal to the number 5 both in value and type.

**Here's an example to illustrate the difference:**


`console.log(5 == '5'); // Output: true`
`console.log(5 === '5'); // Output: false`

<br>

### In conclusion, == is less strict and may lead to unexpected results due to type coercion, while === is more strict and checks for both value and type equality. The use of === is generally recommended over == for more accurate and predictable comparison results.

## 10.What is the use of "this" keyword in JavaScript?

### In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that the currently executing code is associated with. The value of this can change depending on the context in which it is used, and it is often used to access properties and methods of the current object.

### The value of this can be determined in four ways:

### Global context: In the global context, this refers to the global object (window in a web browser).

### Object method: When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object that the method is associated with.

### Constructor: When a function is used with the new operator, this refers to the newly created object.

### Explicit binding: The value of this can also be explicitly set using methods such as call, apply, and bind.

**Here's an example to illustrate the use of this:**

`let person = {`
 ` firstName: 'John',`
  `lastName: 'Doe',`
  `fullName: function() {`
   ` return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;`
  `}`
`};`
`console.log(person.fullName()); // Output: John Doe`

### In this example, the fullName method is a method of the person object, so when it is called, this refers to the person object and can be used to access its properties, firstName and lastName.

### In conclusion, this is an important and widely used keyword in JavaScript that provides a dynamic and flexible way to reference objects and their properties and methods.

## 11. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?
### In JavaScript, code can be executed either synchronously or asynchronously.

### ynchronous code is executed in a blocking manner, meaning that the code will block further execution until it has completed. This can lead to delays and freezes in the user interface if the synchronous code takes a long time to execute.

### Asynchronous code, on the other hand, is executed in a non-blocking manner, meaning that the code can run in the background without stopping further execution. This allows other code to continue executing while the asynchronous code is running, which can improve the responsiveness and performance of the application.

**Here's an example to illustrate the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code:**

`// Synchronous code`
`console.log('Starting synchronous code');`
`for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {}`
`console.log('Ending synchronous code');`

`// Asynchronous code`
`console.log('Starting asynchronous code');`
`setTimeout(function() {`
  `console.log('Ending asynchronous code');`
`}, 0);`

<br>

### In this example, the synchronous code block will block further execution until it has completed, which may take a long time. The asynchronous code block, on the other hand, is executed using the setTimeout function, which runs the code asynchronously in the background and does not block further execution.

### In conclusion, asynchronous code is an important concept in JavaScript and is often used to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications. It allows long-running or time-consuming tasks to be executed in the background without blocking further execution.

## 12. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?

### In JavaScript, errors can be handled using try-catch statements and throwing custom errors.

### A try-catch statement is a way to handle errors that may occur in a block of code. The code to be executed is placed in the try block, and if an error occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block. Here's an example:

`try {`
 ` // Code that may throw an error`
 ` let x = y + 1;`
`} catch (error) {`
  `// Handle the error`
  `console.error(error);`
`}`
### In this example, the code in the try block may throw an error if the variable y is not defined. If an error occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block, where it can be logged or displayed to the user.

### Custom errors can also be thrown using the throw keyword. This allows you to create custom error messages and types that can be caught and handled in the same way as other errors. Here's an example:


`function divide(a, b) {`
 ` if (b === 0) {`
  `  throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero');`
 ` }`
 ` return a / b;`
`}`

`try {`
 ` let result = divide(10, 0);`
 ` console.log(result);`
`} catch (error) {`
 ` console.error(error);`
`}`


<br>

### In this example, the divide function throws a custom error if the second argument is 0. The error is caught in the try-catch statement and logged to the console.

### In conclusion, handling errors in JavaScript is an important aspect of writing robust and reliable code. Try-catch statements and throwing custom errors are two common ways to handle errors in JavaScript, and they allow you to handle errors in a way that is meaningful to your application.

## 13. What is a callback function in JavaScript?

### A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the first function has completed. Callback functions are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests or reading/writing to a file system.

### The idea behind a callback function is that the first function calls the second function (the callback) when it has finished its processing. This allows the second function to access the results of the first function, perform additional processing, and return a value or signal completion.

**Here's an example of a callback function in JavaScript:**

`function doSomething(callback) {`
 ` // Perform some processing`
  `console.log('Processing complete');`

 ` // Call the callback function`
 ` callback();`
`}`

`// Define the callback function`
`function myCallback() {`
 ` console.log('Callback function called');`
`}`

`// Call the doSomething function and pass myCallback as a callback`
  `doSomething(myCallback);`

  <br>

### In this example, the doSomething function takes a callback function as an argument and performs some processing. After the processing is complete, the doSomething function calls the callback function that was passed as an argument. In this case, the myCallback function is called, and its logic is executed.

### Callbacks are widely used in JavaScript and are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations. By allowing functions to be executed after other functions have completed, callbacks allow you to write code that is more organized, efficient, and robu

## 15. What is the difference between method and function in JavaScript?

### In JavaScript, the terms "method" and "function" are used to describe different types of functions.

### A method is a function that is attached to an object. It has access to the object's properties and can modify them, if necessary. A method is invoked using the object's reference, followed by the dot operator (.) and the method name.

**Here's an example of a method in JavaScript:**


`let person = {`
 ` name: 'John Doe',`
`  sayHello: function() {`
    `console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);`
 ` }`
`};`

`person.sayHello();`

<br>

### In this example, the sayHello method is attached to the person object and can be invoked using the person.sayHello() syntax.

### On the other hand, a function is a block of code that can be invoked by its name. Functions can accept parameters, return values, and be used to encapsulate code. Functions can be declared using the function keyword, or as arrow functions (() =>).

**Here's an example of a function in JavaScript:**

`function multiply(a, b) {`
  `return a * b;`
`}`

`let result = multiply(10, 20);`
`console.log(result);`


<br>

### In this example, the multiply function is a standalone function that can be invoked by its name, with two parameters passed as arguments.

### In conclusion, the main difference between a method and a function in JavaScript is that a method is attached to an object, whereas a function is a standalone block of code. Both methods and functions can be used to encapsulate code, accept parameters, and return values, but methods have access to the object's properties and can modify them, if necessary.

## 16. What is prototype in JavaScript?

### In JavaScript, the prototype is a property of functions that allows you to add properties and methods to an object's blueprint. When a new object is created from a constructor function, it inherits all the properties and methods from the prototype.

### The prototype property is automatically created for every function in JavaScript and is used to create an object-oriented inheritance model. This allows you to create new objects based on existing objects, and share common properties and methods between objects.

**Here's an example of using the prototype property in JavaScript:**

`function Person(firstName, lastName) {`
 `this.firstName = firstName;`
 ` this.lastName = lastName;`
`}`

`Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {`
  `console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}.`);`
`};`

`let person = new Person('John', 'Doe');`
`person.sayHello();`

<br>

### In this example, the Person function is a constructor function that creates new Person objects. The Person.prototype property is used to add the sayHello method to the Person object's blueprint. This method can then be invoked on any Person object that is created using the new operator.

### The prototype property is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows you to create objects that share common properties and methods, and provides a mechanism for inheritance and code reuse. Understanding the prototype property is essential for writing effective and efficient JavaScript code.
