## 1. What is Javascript? 
 JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language. It was originally designed for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, but has since become one of the most popular programming languages and is now used for a wide range of applications, including server-side programming, desktop applications, and mobile app development. JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build modern, interactive web applications. It is an object-oriented language with a syntax that is similar to other programming languages such as C and Java. JavaScript is also known for its event-driven and asynchronous programming model, which makes it well suited for building real-time applications.

## 2 . What are the data types in JavaScript?
Number: for numeric values, both integer and floating-point.
String: for sequences of characters, e.g. "hello".
Boolean: for logical values, either true or false.
Undefined: a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
Null: a special value representing the absence of any object value.
Object: for complex data structures, including arrays, functions, and dates.
Symbol: a new data type in ECMAScript 6 that is unique and immutable.

## 3. What are variables in JavaScript?
Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold values which can be of various data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc. Variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords, followed by a name and an optional assignment operator. The value can then be changed or reassigned as needed throughout the code. For example:

**javascript** 

`let name = "John Doe";`

`console.log(name);   // Output: "John Doe"`

`name = "Jane Doe";`

`console.log(name);   // Output: "Jane Doe" `
